# Deprecated

The Web Audio Components Command Line Interface is now deprecated, though the
idea remains open for discussion (hence the existence of this repository). For
example, Component(1) offers search functionality whose solution space includes
every component, whereas, if you're interested in WAC, you may like a more
fine-grained search where the solution space includes only audio components.

If you feel compelled to argue either for or against the existence of a CLI
for this project, please feel free to open an issue!
